![A screenshot of the game in progress](images/GA_proj1_snake_SC.png)

## Getting Started
- The snake begins to move automatically on page load
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement
- The objective is to 'eat' as much fruit as possible, while avoiding colliding with the grid walls or the snake itself 

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Planned improvements
- Option to change the colour of the snake and the fruit
- Add sounds effects for (1) eating fruit (2) winning (3) losing
- Add a game soundtrack with a toggle off button
