- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement
- The objective is to 'eat' as much fruit as possible, while avoiding colliding with the grid walls or the snake itself 

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Planned improvements
- Option to change the colour of the snake and the fruit
